## OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication Backend

### OAuth 2.0 Flow

Generally, a developer must create an "Application" with and identity provider.
e.g. Google, Okta, Azure, etc., and obtain OAuth 2.0 "Client ID" and
"Client Secret".

The authentication flow begins with obtaining "Authorization Code" from an
identity provider.

* What does the portal send to Okta?
  - Client ID
  - Redirect URI
  - Response Type
  - Scope

* What does the portal receive from Okta?
  - Authorization Code

Once, the portal has the "Authorization Code", it could get "Access Token"
to access the user's data at the identity provider.

* What does the portal send to Okta?
  - Authorization Code
  - Client ID
  - Client Secret

* What does Okta respond with?
  - Access Token

* What could the portal use "Access Token" for?
  -  Make API calls to obtain user information

The OpenID Connect (OIDC) adds login and profile information about the person
who is logged in. The differences between standard OAuth2.0 flow are:

1. In the initial request, a specific scope of `openid` is used
2. In the final exchange the Client receives both an "Access Token" and an "ID Token" (JWT Token).

### Adding Role Claims

The Caddyfile `user` directive allows adding roles to
a user based on the user's email.

A user with email claim of `contoso.com` would get an additional `superuser` role.

```
          user jsmith@contoso.com add role superuser
```

A user with the email address beginning with `jsmith` would get additional roles.
Specifically, it would be viewer, editor, and admin.

```
          user "^greenpau" regex add roles viewer editor admin
```

All users with `contoso.com` email address would get "employee" role:

```
          user "@contoso.com$" regex add role employee

```

In sum, Caddyfile may look as follows:

```
myapp.localdomain.local, localhost, 127.0.0.1 {
  route /auth* {
    authp {
      backends {
        google_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm google
          provider google
          client_id XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com
          client_secret YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
          scopes openid email profile
          user "^greenpau" regex add role superuser
        }
```

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers and Identity Providers

The Caddyfile snippet for generic (non-specific) OAuth 2.0 backend.

Based on the below configuration, OAuth 2.0 endpoint is `/auth/oauth2/generic`. If a user
browses to the endpoint, the user will be redirected to the provider discovered via
`metadata_url` and `base_auth_url` URLs.

```
127.0.0.1, localhost {
  route /auth* {
    authp {
      backends {
        generic_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm generic
          provider generic
          client_id XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
          client_secret YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
          scopes openid email profile
        }
```

Next, protect a route, e.g. `/sso/oauth2/generic*`. When a user accesses the page, the
the user will be redirected to `/auth/oauth2/generic` and, then, to the provider. Once authenticated,
the user will be redirected back to `/sso/oauth2/generic...`, i.e. back to the path the user
came from.

```
  route /sso/oauth2/generic* {
    jwt {
      set auth url /auth/oauth2/generic
    }
    respond * "generic oauth2 sso" 200
  }
```

#### Okta

Create an "Application," by browsing to "Applications" and clicking
"Add Application" button.

For a website, the choice is "Web".

![Okta Developer - New App Choice](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_okta_new_app_choice.png)

Provided your application is running on localhost port 8443, provide the following
information:

Base URI entries:
* `https://myapp.localdomain.local:8443/`
* `https://localhost:8443/`

Login redirect URIs:
* `https://myapp.localdomain.local:8443/auth/oauth2/okta/authorization-code-callback`
* `https://localhost:8443/auth/oauth2/okta/authorization-code-callback`

Logout redirect URIs:
* `https://myapp.localdomain.local:8443/auth/logout`
* `https://localhost:8443/auth/logout`

Group Assignments:
* Everyone
* Viewer
* Editor
* Administrator

Grant type allowed:
* Client acting on behalf of itself
  - Client Credentials: No
* Client acting on behalf of a user
  - Authorization Code: Yes
  - Refresh Token: No
  - Implicit (Hybrid): No


![Okta Developer - New App Setup](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_okta_new_app.png)

Review the newly created application.

![Okta Developer - Settings - General](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_okta_app_settings_01.png)

Store the credentials securely.

![Okta Developer - Settings - Client Credentials](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_okta_app_settings_02.png)

Review default Sign On Policy.

![Okta Developer - Settings - Sign On](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_okta_app_settings_03.png)

By default, the default Authorization Server has no `groups` scope.

Therefore, browse to "API", "Authorization Servers" and select "default".

![Okta Developer - API](./assets/docs/images/okta_configure_scope_01.png)

![Okta Developer - API](./assets/docs/images/okta_configure_scope_02.png)

Next, browse to "Scopes" and click "Add Scope".

Fill out the "Add Scope" form:
* Name: `groups`
* Description: `This allows the app to view your group memberships.`
* Check "Set as a default scope"
* Check "Include in public metadata"

![Okta Developer - Add Scope](./assets/docs/images/okta_configure_scope_03.png)

Next, browse to "Claims" and click "Add Claim".

Fill out the "Add Claim" form:
* Name: `groups`
* Include in token type: "ID Token", "Always"
* Value type: Groups
* Filter: Matches `.*` regex
* Include in: The "groups" scope

![Okta Developer - Add Scope](./assets/docs/images/okta_configure_scope_04.png)

Next, review [Okta OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 API - Get Started](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#get-started).

The Caddyfile snipper for Okta OAuth 2.0 backend is as follows.

Based on the below configuration, Okta endpoint is `/auth/oauth2/okta`. If a user
browses to the endpoint, the user will be redirected to Okta.

```
127.0.0.1, localhost {
  route /auth* {
    authp {
      backends {
        okta_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm okta
          provider okta
          domain_name dev-680653.okta.com
          client_id 0oa121qw81PJW0Tj34x7
          client_secret b3aJC5E59hU18YKC7Yca3994F4qFhWiAo_ZojanF
          server_id default
          scopes openid email profile groups
        }
```

Next, protect a route, e.g. `/sso/oauth2/okta*`. When a user accesses the page, the
the user will be redirected to `/auth/oauth2/okta` and, then, to Okta. Once authenticated,
the user will be redirected back to `/sso/oauth2/okta...`, i.e. back to the path the user
came from.

```
  route /sso/oauth2/okta* {
    jwt {
      set auth url /auth/oauth2/okta
    }
    respond * "okta oauth2 sso" 200
  }
```

Provided the Okta domain is `dev-680653.okta.com`, the authorization server is
`default`, and Client ID is `0oa121qw81PJW0Tj34x7`, check OpenID configuration:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://dev-680653.okta.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration?client_id=0oa121qw81PJW0Tj34x7" | jq
```

By default, the plugin logs public keys from `keys` endpoint.

* [Google Identity Platform - Identity Platform - OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect)

The Caddyfile snippet for Google OAuth 2.0 OpenID backend is as follows.

Based on the below configuration, Google endpoint is `/auth/oauth2/google`. If a user
browses to the endpoint, the user will be redirected to Google.

```
127.0.0.1, localhost {
  route /auth* {
    authp {
      backends {
        google_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm google
          provider google
          client_id XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com
          client_secret YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
          scopes openid email profile
        }
```

Next, protect a route, e.g. `/sso/oauth2/google*`. When a user accesses the page, the
the user will be redirected to `/auth/oauth2/google` and, then, to Google. Once authenticated,
the user will be redirected back to `/sso/oauth2/google...`, i.e. back to the path the user
came from.

```
  route /sso/oauth2/google* {
    jwt {
      set auth url /auth/oauth2/google
    }
    respond * "google oauth2 sso" 200
  }
```

First, create new application, e.g. "My Gatekeeper".

![Google Identity Platform - Identity Platform - New Application](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_google_new_app.png)

After the creation of the app, you will land on Credentials page.

![Google Identity Platform - Identity Platform - Credentials](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_google_credentials.png)

Click "Configure Consent Screen" and select an appropriate option, e.g. "External".

#### Microsoft

To register an OAuth2 application for login with Microsoft accounts
(either personal, i.e. Live or Xbox accounts, or enterprise,
i.e. AzureAD accounts), you can follow the documentation at
`https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/authentication-oauth-identity-platform`.

In summary, you open the `Azure Active Directory` section on
`https://portal.azure.com` and navigate to `App registrations`.

![Azure Active Directory - App registrations](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_azure_new_app.png)

There you select `New registration` and enter your application's name,
your choice of supported account types and the the redirect URI

```
https://localhost:8443/auth/oauth2/azure/authorization-code-callback
```

![Azure Active Directory - App registrations - New application](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_azure_new_application_details.png)

As soon as the application registration was successfully created, you
can note down its `Application (client) ID` listed in the `Essentials`
section at the top.

![Azure Active Directory - App registrations - My Application](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_azure_application_id.png)

Finally, you need to generate a client secret to authenticate
`caddy-auth-portal`. In the sidebar, navigate to `Certificates and
secrets` and click on `New client secret`.

![Azure Active Directory - App registrations - My Application - Certificates and secrets](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_azure_secrets.png)

After the secret was successfully created, copy its value (you won't
be able to retrieve it again!).

![Azure Active Directory - App registrations - My Application - Client secret](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_azure_client_secret.png)

You now have all the necessary information to use the backend in your
`Caddyfile`:

```
        azure_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm azure
          provider azure
          client_id 840e455a-69af-47bb-b033-b3a316f1aff0
          client_secret MnE~D8G5Dh_gWRq_jc3uJ8Q8wjBqBv.N3r
          scopes openid email profile
        }
```

If you chose `Accounts in this organizational directory only` as the
account type, you additionally need to add the line

```
          tenant_id <your tenant ID>
```

where the `tenant ID` can either be the actual Directory ID, or its
friendly name `<something>.onmicrosoft.com`.

#### Github

Follow the instructions at `https://github.com/settings/apps/new`.

GitHub App name: "My Gatekeeper"

Description: "Caddy v2 Authentication Portal"

Homepage URL: `https://localhost:8443/`

User authorization callback URL: `https://localhost:8443/auth/oauth2/github/authorization-code-callback`

Check "Expire user authorization tokens".

Check "Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation"

Upon successful completion of the instructions, you will get:

![Settings - Developer settings - GitHub Apps - My Gatekeeper](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_github_new_app.png)

Additionally, click "generate a private key" to sign access token requests.

![Settings - Developer settings - GitHub Apps - My Gatekeeper - Private Keys](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_github_sign_keys.png)


Caddyfile configuration:

```
        github_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm github
          provider github
          client_id CLIENT_ID
          client_secret CLIENT_SECRET
          scopes user
        }
```

The `github` provider does not have mail claim, i.e. email address. Therefore,
if there is a need to assign a role to a user, one could user `user` directive
to match on `sub`, i.e. subject claim. The `sub` claim is in the format of
`github.com/<GITHUB_HANDLE>`.

```
        github_oauth2_backend {
          ...
          user github.com/greenpau add role superuser
        }
```

The users authenticating via Github would have to accept the terms:

click "Set Up" next to "Facebook Login" product:

![Facebook Developers - App Screen](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_facebook_app_screen.png)

When at Quickstart screen, select "Other".

Next, click "Settings - Advanced" on the left navigation bar and browse to "Security" section.

Set "Require App Secret" to "Yes".
The Client Token is not being used because `client_secret` is being used to calculate `appsecret_proof`.

![Facebook Developers - App Settings - Advanced](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_facebook_app_settings_advanced_screen.png)

Next, click "Settings - Basic" on the left navigation bar and extract "App Secret".
The App Secret is used in `client_secret` Caddyfile directive.

![Facebook Developers - App Settings - Basic](./assets/docs/images/oauth2_facebook_app_settings_basic_screen.png)

Next, click "Settings" under "Facebook Login" on the left navigation bar and browse to "Client OAuth Settings" section:

Set "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" to:

* `https://localhost:8443/auth/oauth2/facebook/authorization-code-callback`

Additionally, add the URL in "Redirect URI Validator":

* `https://localhost:8443/auth/oauth2/facebook/authorization-code-callback`

The Caddyfile config is as follows:

```
127.0.0.1, localhost {
  route /auth* {
    authp {
      backends {
        facebook_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          realm facebook
          provider facebook
          client_id 38409328409
          client_secret 11899bfcd5745a8ed20235c65638f311
        }
```

When a user get redirected to Facebook Login, the screen looks as follows:

### OAuth 2.0 Endpoint Delayed Start

The following configuration allows delaying getting key material of upstream
OAuth 2.0 server.

```
      backends {
        google_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          ...
          delay_start 5
```

This would delay querying the upstream server for 5 seconds.

[:arrow_up: Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### OAuth 2.0 Endpoint Retry Attempts

The following configuration permits for retries when getting key material of
upstream OAuth 2.0 server.

```
      backends {
        google_oauth2_backend {
          method oauth2
          ...
          retry_attempts 3
          retry_interval 10
```

If unsuccessful at reaching a remote OAuth 2.0 server, the plugin would
try connecting 2 more times at 10 second intervals.
